Feature: Brigade form only allows cities without a Brigade to create a new one
 
  As a user
  I would like to get an error in real time if I try to create a Brigade in a city that already has one
  So that multiple Brigades don't get created for the same city
  
#  Background: Brigades in database
#
#     Given the following brigades exist:
#      | location_id  | user_id | description                                         | calendar_url                                                                              | header_image_url                                                   |
