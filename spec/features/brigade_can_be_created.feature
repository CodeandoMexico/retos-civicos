Feature: Brigade can be created

  As a user
  I would like to be able to create a brigade
  So that I can start getting those in my area active civically.

#  Scenario: create brigade page
#    Given I am logged in as a user with email "k@kboss.com" and name "Kyle Boss"
#    When I visit the brigade creation page
#    And I fill in "location-query" with "Monterrey"
#    And I wait for AJAX
#    And I should see "Nuevo Le√≥n"
#    And I click on location option with city "Monterrey"
#    And I fill in "brigade[description]" with "I am Monterrey yo!"
#    And I fill in "brigade[header_image_url]" with "http://www.dronestagr.am/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cerrosilla.png"
#    And I click on "commit"
#    Then I should see "Monterrey"
#    And "Kyle Boss" should be the organizer
