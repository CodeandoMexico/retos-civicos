      problem:
        title: Current landscape
        description: "<blockquote>\"Government has shown itself consistently unable
          to keep pace with the fast-evolving power of the Internet.\"[1]</blockquote><p>
          Moreover, the vast majority of its projects are tendered to a small number
          of contractors, who are building expensive and complex systems on long-term
          contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why the <i>open government</i> and <i>civic
          hacking </i> movements are taking traction. These movements strive for a
          government that works as a platform, as opposed to the traditional bureaucracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
          this search for civic innovation, a trend of hackathons has emerged all
          around the world, from Norway[2] to Latin America[3], with the purpose of
          connecting hackers and designers with NGOs and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These
          events are a first attempt to bring the community together with a shared
          goal, however we haven't seen projects of real impact, mainly because hackathons
          fall into <i>solutionism</i>[4], pouring many hours of talent on building
          projects without a clear understanding of our community needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
          need to reinvent this interaction and start investing these thousands of
          hours into solving real problems.</p>"

          specific issues of our communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These challenges follow
          the rules of any virtual contest: registration, deadlines, requirements,
          clear specs of the solution, judges and prizes.</p>"
